   My name is Benajamin Bradley Rivers. 
I'm from Dixon, MS, but most recognize the nearest towns, Philadelphia and Union. 
I'm twenty six in November and the reason that I'm a little older in school is because I went to a junior college and learned a trade first. 
I did this so I could save to afford a universtiy. 
My wife and I got married right after high shcool and have been together for almost a decade.
We own our own house but currently live in a VERY SMALL camper in Starkville becuase the rent is much less compared to apartments.
